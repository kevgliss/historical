## About
These are the serverless configuration files needed to various pieces of historical infrastructure. These are configuration files only. Historical itself is located at:

https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/historical


## Monitoring

All of the functions are wrapped with the `RavenLambdaWrapper`. This decorator forwards lambda
telemetry to a [Sentry](https://sentry.io) instance. This will have no effect unless you specify `SENTRY_DSN`
in the Lambda's environment variables.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the tests:

    py.test
